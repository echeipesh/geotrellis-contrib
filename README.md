# GeoTrellis Contributions repo

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/geotrellis/geotrellis-contrib.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/geotrellis/geotrellis-contrib)

This is a repository is a place to put extra [GeoTrellis](https://github.com/locationtech/geotrellis) projects, that were not included into the main repo for various reasons.

 - Project names should be of the form `geotrellis-contrib-{feature}`
 - Project versions should start with `0.0.1` and not be tied to GeoTrellis version.
 - Project publishing will happen on BinTray
